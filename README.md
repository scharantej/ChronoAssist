## Flask Application Design for a Personal Assistant App

## HTML Files

1. **main.html**: The main interface of the app with a view of current in-progress tasks, a daily calendar, and a chat interface.
2. **horizontal-focus.html**: A specialized view with an optimized layout for horizontal focus, designed for desktop use.
3. **vertical-focus.html**: A specialized view with an optimized layout for vertical focus, designed for mobile use.
4. **feedback.html**: A dedicated page where users can provide feedback on the app's performance and suggest ways to improve it.

## Routes

1. **main**: Serves the main.html file and sets up the necessary state variables and logic for the main interface.
2. **task-add**: Accepts a POST request with task details (e.g., description, priority) and adds it to the current in-progress task list.
3. **task-update**: Accepts a POST request with updated task details and updates the corresponding task in the task list.
4. **task-delete**: Accepts a POST request with the task ID and removes it from the task list.
5. **calendar-update**: Accepts a POST request with calendar event details and updates the daily calendar accordingly.
6. **chat-message**: Accepts a POST request with the user's message and interacts with the language model to provide a response.
7. **feedback-submit**: Accepts a POST request with user feedback and stores it for analysis and incorporation into future app enhancements.
